# Overview

API - NARUTO
## Why Building It ?

I'm currently learning nodejs and I was wondering how could I use my new knowledge and an idea pop in my mind and that the API is his result. It's not responsive at all I was mainly focus on having fun to build the API and the design is very simple and I like it 

## How to use it

- Use git clone https://github.com/Jexinte/API---NARUTO.git
- Go in the backend folder and launch npm install
- Then launch nodemon and test it !
