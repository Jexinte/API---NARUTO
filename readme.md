# Overview

I'm re-learning Nodejs and I was wondering how to best integrate my knowledge and obviously practice was the right answer however I didn't want to go on any project where I wouldn't enjoy building my API so an idea came to my mind.

I love the work of Masashi Kishimoto known as "Naruto" and I simply said to myself that I could create cards of characters on which at the click you could have a small overview of the history of the characters and also have the possibility to display only the characters according to their villages.

The API is not responsive it was not the goal the important for me was to have fun and it's done so I can continue my learning! Who knows, maybe soon I'll add the possibility to create your own character card of the same universe?


## How to use it

- Use git clone https://github.com/Jexinte/API---NARUTO.git
- Go in the backend folder and launch npm install
- Then launch nodemon and test it !
